# Todo App  
## Overview
This is a simple Todo App built using Qt and C++. The app allows users to add tasks, remove specific tasks, and remove all tasks. Additionally, the app saves the tasks so that they are not erased when you close and reopen the application.

## Features
+ Add Task: Add new tasks to your todo list.
+ Remove Task: Remove a specific task from your todo list.
+ Clear All Tasks: Remove all tasks from your todo list.
+ Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved and loaded automatically, ensuring they are not lost when the application is closed and reopened.
